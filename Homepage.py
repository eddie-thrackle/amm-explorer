Token bonding curves and AMMs,
Two sides of the same coin, it seems.
One a mechanism for price discovery,
The other for liquidity, it beams.

Token bonding curves, a new way to raise,
A method for creating value,
It aligns incentives, and allows for growth,
A path for projects to pursue.

Automated market makers, on the other hand,
Provide liquidity for all to see,
They allow for easy buying and selling,
And make the markets more efficient and free.

Together, they form a powerful pair,
A duality that's hard to ignore,
One for creating value, the other for trading,
A symbiotic relationship, evermore.

Token bonding curves and AMMs,
Two sides of the blockchain coin,
Both vital for the growth and progress,
Of the decentralized economy, we join.
